				<summary>Mario Gotze's Story</summary>
				<p> Mario Götze is a German professional footballer known for his versatility, technical skills, and famous winning goal in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final. Born on June 3, 1992, in Memmingen, Germany, Götze began his football career at a young age, joining the youth academy of Borussia Dortmund, one of Germany's top clubs.<br>
				He made his senior debut for Borussia Dortmund in 2009 at the age of 17, quickly establishing himself as one of the most promising talents in German football. Götze played a crucial role in Dortmund's success under manager Jürgen Klopp, helping the team win two consecutive Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012.<br>
				His performances caught the attention of top European clubs, and in 2013, Götze made a controversial move to Bayern Munich, Dortmund's domestic rivals, for a then-German record transfer fee. At Bayern Munich, he continued to excel, winning several domestic titles and the UEFA Champions League under the management of Pep Guardiola.<br>
				However, Götze's time at Bayern Munich was marked by injuries and inconsistency, and he struggled to secure a regular place in the starting lineup. In 2016, he returned to Borussia Dortmund, where he hoped to rediscover his best form.<br>
				Despite facing challenges, Götze remained a popular figure among football fans for his technical ability and vision on the pitch. However, his career reached a significant milestone in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the final against Argentina, with the score tied at 0-0 in extra time, Götze scored a stunning goal with his chest and left foot, securing Germany's fourth World Cup title.<br>
				While Götze's career had its highs and lows, his World Cup-winning goal secured his place in football history. After his return to Borussia Dortmund, he continued to contribute to the team's success before moving to other clubs to further his career. Throughout his journey, Mario Götze remains a symbol of talent, determination, and the ability to rise to the occasion on the biggest stage.<br>
